## 🖌 Overview  
ArchiCAD BIM Studio is a professional Building Information Modeling application built for architects who value design precision, documentation accuracy, and collaborative workflows. It enables creation of comprehensive architectural projects while maintaining intelligent building data through integrated BIM technology.

With its *parametric design engine*, ArchiCAD BIM Studio handles complex 3D modeling, floor plans, and sections even with large multi-story buildings. The *virtual building technology* ensures all views stay synchronized automatically as designs evolve.

The comprehensive interface makes architectural design, documentation, and visualization accessible for both solo practitioners and large firms. Users can model buildings, generate construction documents, and create photorealistic renderings while maintaining data consistency.

ArchiCAD BIM Studio includes features like *intelligent walls*, *parametric objects*, and *automated schedules* that streamline architectural workflows. Its BIMcloud integration enables real-time collaboration with consultants and team members.

From residential designers to commercial architects, ArchiCAD BIM Studio is trusted by millions for designing buildings, producing construction documents, and coordinating projects — redefining architectural design excellence for building professionals.
